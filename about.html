      <h1>About Our Company</h1>

      <p>In 1952, our grandfather had one mission and one mission: making a BBQ sauce that will be the best in the country
          and used in every BBQ. This was our grandfathers goal in life and strove to be the leading competitor in the
          BBQ sauce world.<p>

	<p>He spent countless hours working on a BBQ that was unique and like no other style of BBQ in America at the time. He wanted to revolutionize on how BBQ would not only taste but how it was uniquely made. Around 1954 our grandfather final had created a recipe that was unique to other BBQ sauce and was finally satisfied with his own product. After countless years of trying Dads BBq was finally made and put into action.<p>

	<P> Without the countless hours our grandfather had put in we would not be able to have this company today. With all
             our countless help he was able to spread his love of cooking homemade BBQ with us and the people of this country.
             Our goal is to share the same dream our grandfather had and continue making a BBQ sauce that can still be
             used generation to generation, and still make a quality product that people will still continue to love in
             there homes and in restaurants.</p>
