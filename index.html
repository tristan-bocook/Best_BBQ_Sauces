        <p class="review">I didn't believe Michael Jackson had tried and liked this sauce so I figured I needed a go around with this supposed
        one of kind sauces and let me tell you I was impressed. I will admit that when I was backed in a corner I thought about

        <p class="review">I don't normally try barbecue sauces but I heard two celebrities enjoyed Dad's BBQ line of sauce and I had try some for myself. The sauces are fantastic and brings many memories of
        barbecues my family threw when I was a little girl. I speak on behalf of the other locals and people who've had the
        sauce: You need to try this!</p>
